- Project Description
	- This is a 2D platforming game being built with the Unity engine.  It is a clone of the 1992 NES game, "Mr. Gimmick."
	- This project is "officially" completed after 2 months of work.  Minor changes may be made in the future.
	- This project was done in collaboration with two others (see Collaborators).  None of us three had any experience with Unity prior to this project.
